CSCI 3010 Ind. Project Checkpoint 1

1.) Plan from previous HW:

I will complete the game functionality in the GUI version of the game, add comments, add at least one level of difficulty and then move on to testing. Features that will be added to the game will be the ability to select the winning score to play to and the ability to select the difficulty of the game. I will have a method of testing the game using one of the testing frameworks that we went over in class.

2.) What I accomplished:

I was able to fix the problem with the game not giving the correct winner of the hand but it still cannot play a full game. I learned how to use the debugger which is useful but it took a long time.

3.)For next checkpoint:

(Same as last time)
I will complete the game functionality in the GUI version of the game, add comments, add at least one level of difficulty and then move on to testing. Features that will be added to the game will be the ability to select the winning score to play to and the ability to select the difficulty of the game. I will have a method of testing the game using one of the testing frameworks that we went over in class.
